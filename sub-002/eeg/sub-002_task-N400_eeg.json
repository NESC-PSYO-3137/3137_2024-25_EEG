  "TaskDescription": "The N400 was elicited using a word pair judgment task adapted from Holcomb & Kutas (1990). On each trial, a red prime word was followed by a green target word. Participants responded whether the target word was semantically related or unrelated to the prime word.",
  "Instructions": "In this task, a pair of words will be presented in the center of the screen: one [PRIME_COLOR] word followed by one [TARGET_COLOR] word. Your task is to respond whether the two words are related to each other or unrelated to each other. If the [TARGET_COLOR] word is related to the [PRIME_COLOR] word, press the [RELATED_BUTTON]. If the [TARGET_COLOR] word is unrelated to the [PRIME_COLOR] word, press the [UNRELATED_BUTTON]. Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.",
